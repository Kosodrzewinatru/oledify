# App for making your wallpapers perfect for oled/amoled displays

Oledify is a simple app for processing images which include dark colors, but not pitch black. It's great if you don't want to use pre-prepared wallpapers for amoled panels, but use one of your fovorite instead and still benefit from this delightful deep blackness.
