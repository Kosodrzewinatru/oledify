# App for making your wallpapers perfect for oled/amoled displays

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/Kosodrzewinatru/oledify/badge?style=flat-square)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/Kosodrzewinatru/oledify)

Oledify is a simple app for processing images which include dark colors, but not pitch black. It's great if you don't want to use pre-prepared wallpapers for amoled panels, but use one of your fovorite instead and still benefit from this delightful deep blackness.

## Installation

Just go to the "release" tab and download the latest apk. You may encounter a problem with app not wanting to install. If that happens, delete the previous version and try again.
